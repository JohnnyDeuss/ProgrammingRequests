# SubliminalWordGenerator

The SubliminalWordGenerator.html file is a web page that generates subliminal
words in the center of the screen. Since it is just a single web page, written
in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, it can be run by double clicking it, which open it
in your default browser.

At the bottom of the code, there is a block of code marked with `Configuration`.
Here, you can configure which words are shown and how fast they are shown.
To view the code, you will have to open the HTML file from a program that will
interpret it as text and not as a web page. These are programs like `notepad` on
Windows and `Text Edit` on Mac. If you want this in video format, just record
your screen.
