# SubliminalWordGenerator

This is a web page that generates subliminal words in the center of the
screen.

At the bottom of the code, there is a block of code marked with `Configuration`.
Here, you can configure which words are shown and how fast they are shown.
If you want this in video format, just record your screen.
