# SubliminalWordGenerator

The SubliminalWordGenerator.html file is a web page that generates subliminal
words in the center of the screen. Since it is just a single web page, written
in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, it can be run by double clicking it, which open it
in your default browser.

At the bottom of the code, there is a block of code marked with `Configuration`.
Here, you can configure which words are shown and how fast they are shown.
To view the code, you will have to open the HTML file from a program that will
interpret it as text and not as a web page. These are programs like `notepad` on
Windows and `Text Edit` on Mac. If you want this in video format, just record
your screen.

You can load words from a URL, just Google `English word list` or
`10000 most common English words list` and things like that. The script can
parse quite a few formats, but not everything. Most lists either contain only
easy words or exotic words and names. Some pages can't be loaded by the script
because the websites hosting them ask them not to load them if they aren't
requested from their website. This can be circumvented, but this is not easy for
laymen.
