# StatementIterator

The StatementIterator.html file is a web page that shows statement by statement
when pressing space. Since it is just a single web page, written in HTML, CSS
and JavaScript, it can be run by double clicking it, which open it in your
default browser.

At the bottom of the code, there is a block of code marked with `Configuration`.
Here, you can configure which statements are shown. To view the code, you will
have to open the HTML file from a program that will interpret it as text and not
as a web page. These are programs like `notepad` on Windows and `Text Edit` on
Mac.
